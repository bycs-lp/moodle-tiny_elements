# Elements

A plugin for the Moodle TinyMCE editor providing customizable components for structuring learning content. It contains sets of visual components designed explicitly for learning
* from componentsforlearning.org (by Roger Segú) and 
* teaching avatars by Dunja Speckner.

No configuration settings are required for this plugin. Just install it from the Site Administration area (Plugins → Install plugins → Install plugin from ZIP file). 

Once the plugin is installed, a button and a menu item will be visible in the TinyMCE editor. There is one setting to preview the components when hover the mouse cursor over each component, it is enabled by default, to change it modify enablepreview setting on Site Administration area → Plugins → Text Editors → TinyMCE editor → Elements.

The capability 'tiny/elements:viewplugin' allows to configure the plugin visibility to any role.

This plugin is a fork of tiny_elements https://moodle.org/plugins/tiny_elements) by Marc Català and Roger Segú and also based on their work on atto_elements (https://moodle.org/plugins/atto_elements). These are part of a broader, collaborative project called Components for Learning (https://componentsforlearning.org). You will find there all the related documentation and detailed usage recommendations and examples for the elements set of components included here.
